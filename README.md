Server, Client View, and multiplayer - Gurumanie Singh

### How to play:

The server.py should be ran to start.  
Each player can join by running the client.py.  

If you have possession of the ball, you want to choose a number that the other player won't choose.  
If you are defending (other player has possession), then you want to try to choose the same number as the other player.  
When you reach the goal you must shoot. Shooting uses inputs 4,5,6.  
Trying to shoot (4,5,6) when ***not*** at the goal yet will result in a penalty. Trying to pass (1,2,3) when at the goal will result in a penalty.
